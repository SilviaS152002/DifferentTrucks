Again, just a library that someone can build off.

How to designate different trucks:
Change:
﻿`"truckIdentifier": "truck.aar.a",`
to
`﻿"truckIdentifier": "truck.aar.a, truck.aar.b",`
 
At the moment, it is limited to 2 trucks (first and last) on diesel locomotives and cars (No steam locomotive support because they use a different system), but this serves as the first step to get by these limitations. ~~Schnabel anyone?~~
